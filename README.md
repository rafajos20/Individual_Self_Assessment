### Segment 3
Sport prediction is usually treated as a classification problem, with one class (win, lose, or draw) to be predicted. Although some researchers, have also looked at the numeric prediction problem, where they predict the winning margin â€“ a numeric value. In sport prediction, large numbers of features can be collected including the historical performance of the teams, results of matches, and data on players, to help different stakeholders understand the odds of winning or losing forthcoming matches. The decision of which team is likely to win is what we are aiming to predict.
